## Documentation

    npm run docs

This generates documentation with jsdoc in the docs directory (ignored by git) and also updates the README.md file.


## Command line script

If `mondo-bank` is installed with the global `-g` flag, the CLI script `mondo` will be available.

Otherwise, ensure that `bin/mondo-cli.js` is in your path.

### CLI usage

All methods are supported as commands of the CLI script.

2 additional commands are provided:

- write

  Enables writing values to config file
- deleteToken

  Deletes any saved tokens

Please refer to the built-in documentation for further details.

    mondo --help

### Bash completion

Programmable completions are provided for commands and options by the `mondo.completions.bash` file in the module’s bin directory. Either source the file directly or copy it to wherever your system looks for completion files.

### CLI config files

By default, the `mondo` cli tool looks for its config file (`mondo-cli.config.json`) in the user’s home directory.

To override this, pass the config option or set the `mondo-cli.config` environment variable.

The config file stores developer and user details, app tokens and any default values for command options.
